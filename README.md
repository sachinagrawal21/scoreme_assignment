Created a simple pdf segmenter which takes a pdf and no of segments as input and returns pdfs divided into the no of segments.

To setup simply just pull the repo and run it.
Upon running it will ask for the path of the pdf and no of segments and will return numerous pdfs depending upon the no of cuts.
